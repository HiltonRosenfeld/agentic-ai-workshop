## ‚ö°Ô∏è Open this tutorial on Github Codespaces
To make life easier, we'll use the awesome Github Codespace functionality. Github offers you a completely integrated developer experience and resources to get started quickly. How?

1. Open the [agentic-ai-workshop](https://github.com/michelderu/agentic-ai-workshop) repository
2. Click on `Use this template`->`Ceate new repository` as follows:

    ![codespace](./assets/create-new-repository.png)

3. Now select your github account and name the new repository. Ideally also set the description. Click `Create repository`

    ![codespace](./assets/repository-name.png)

4. Cool! You just created a copy in your own Gihub account! Now let's get started with coding. Click `Create codespace on main` as follows:

    ![codespace](./assets/create-codespace.png)

5. Configure the secrets as follows:

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Edit `.env` and provide the required variables `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT` and `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`

6. Now we can run Langflow as follows in the terminal window:

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv sync
    uv run langflow run --env-file .env
    ```

    This starts Langflow and opens a port to your Codespace in the cloud. In case you loose track of the URL to Langflow, just click on `PORTS` in the terminal window.

üéâ Congrats! You finished the set-up part of the workshop. Now for the fun part!

## üì¶ Workshop follow-along

### 1. üß± Setup of a simple Langflow Chatbot
**Goal:** Create a chatbot with: input ‚Üí model ‚Üí output

#### Steps:
1. Open Langflow
2. Click `+ New Flow` / `+ Blank Flow`
3. Collapse `Inputs` and drag the `Chat Input` component to the canvas
4. Collapse `Models` and drag the `OpenAI` component to the canvas. Connect `Input` to the `Chat Input`
5. Collapse `Outputs` and drag the `Chat Output` component to the canvas. Connect `Message` to the `Chat Output` component

![chatbot-flow](./assets/chatbot-flow.png)

üëè Amazing! You just built your first flow. Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What's the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

You'll see the Large Language Model (LLM) answer your question nicely!

### 2. üß≠ Familiarize yourself with Langflow
**Goal:** Understand the main components of Langflow

#### Steps:
1. If still open, close the Playground popup
2. Select `Chat Input` and click `Controls`
3. You'll see a field name `Text`, type `What's the difference between AI and Machine Learning` in the text field. close the popup
4. Select `Chat Output`, the three dots `...` and click `Expand`
5. Do the same with `Chat Input`
6. Click the play button `‚ñ∂Ô∏è` on the `Chat Output` component and see the flow run

Notice the running time of the separate components.  
Click the magnifying glass `üîç` in the `OpenAI` component. This shows you a popup with the intermediate data that is passed to the next component. Very useful for debugging purposes!

### 3. üß† Agentic AI with Langflow
**Goal:** Create an AI Agent that has access to a URL tool and a Calculator tool

![basic-agentic-ai](./assets/basic-agentic-ai.png)

#### Steps:
1. Reproduce the above flow (or load it from `./flows/basic-agentic-ai.json`)
2. Esure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` has been set
3. When adding the `URL` and `Calculator` components to the canvas, select them and click `Tool mode`

üëè Amazing! You just built your first AI Agent. Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What is 2x the value of a Euro in Dollars

You'll get an answer stating a value of $2.16 or something (as of April 2025).

To see the magic behind, simply click the down arrow `üîΩ`. The Agent decided to use two tools:
1. The URL tool to fetch the current exchange rates
2. The Calculator tool to multiply the value by two

### 4. üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Astra DB
**Goal:** Adding external knowledge by making use of Vector Search and RAG

#### Preparation: Creating an FAQ collection
In this step we'll create a new collection in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) to store data as a knowledge base.

First we need to create a collection to store the data:
1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `Create Collection +`
3. Type your collection name, i.e. `company_faq` and enebale `Vector-enabled collection`
4. Leave NVIDIA, NV-Embed-QA, 1024 and Cosine as it is
5. Click `Create Collection`

![astra-new-collection](./assets/astra-new-collection.png)

You just created a new empty collection to store knowledge base articles.

#### Steps: Add Astra DB as a RAG tool in Langflow
Extend your existing Basic Agentic AI flow with the following:
1. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
2. Click the component and select `Tool mode`
3. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
4. Connect it to the `Agent` component

![astra-rag-agent](./assets/astra-rag-agent.png)

Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What are your shipping times?

As a response we get a generic answer. Why? Because our collection is still empty. Let's fix that!

#### Steps: Add some articles to our knowledge base
Extend your flow with the following additional flow (scroll down a bit for a blank piece of canvas):
1. Collapse `Data` and drag `File` to the canvas
2. Click on `Upload a file` and upload the `Company_FAQ.pdf` from this repository (you'll have to download it first)
3. Collapse `Langchain` and drag `Recursive Character Splitter` to the canvas
4. Set the `Chunk size` to 500 and `Chunk overlap` to 100
5. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
6. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
7. Click the play button `‚ñ∂Ô∏è` on the `Astra DB` component, see the flow run and observe the time consumed. You can also click the intermediate magnifying glasses `üîç` to debug the flow.

![astra-ingest](./assets/astra-ingest.png)

üôå Congrats! You just loaded a PDF, converted it to plain text, chunked it and loaded it into a Vector enabled collection in Astra DB!

#### üëÄ Check: Have a look at the data in Astra DB
In this step we'll have a look at the dataset in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com).

1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `company_faq`
3. Observe the data loaded into the collection on the right side of the screen
4. Toggle from `Table` to `JSON` view and collapse some of the rows to see what's inside

To see Vector Search in action, type the following in the text box `Vector Search`:

    What are the shipping times

You'll see the chunk with shipping times show up as the first result. You just ran an ANN search transparantly utilizing the Vectorize functionality in Astra DB that does the vectorization for you on demand.

#### üöÄ Now let's run the Agent in Langflow
Click on `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and click on `+` on the left side to start a new Chat. Then run the following question:

    How many hours do I need to wait for a domestic order?

You'll see the Agent making use of the Astra DB knowledge base to find relevant content and then running the calculator to calculate the amount of hours to wait üéâ
